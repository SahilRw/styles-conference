                        <h5>Designing To Learn</h5>
                        <p>We’ve reached a point where non-designers understand the value of design. This has led to an increase in demand for design talent. In the past, we would have turned to institutions of higher education to help us find new talent; however, today’s graduates often finish school without the skills they need to thrive in a professional design setting.

There is a massive gap between what students learn and what industry needs. This skills gap leaves graduates unable to find jobs and hiring companies unable to find talent. How we approach this challenge will affect the continued relevance and value of design.</p>
